Contact List App is a simple contact list that allows users to add, update,
and delete contacts. This app was developed using the MEAN stack. 

***Requirements ~ you must have MongoDB and NodeJs installed to run this app***
 
Step #1 
   Start MongoDB ~ in your command prompt window navigate to that MongoDB 
  folder and enter the "mongod"command. Leave this window open and running!

Step#2
   Start Node server ~ in a different command prompt window, change directories
   to the contact list app master folder and enter the "node server" command. 
   Also leave this window open and running! 

Step#3 
   Running the App ~ Open your browser and at the top enter "localhost:3000" 
this will take you to the web app!
